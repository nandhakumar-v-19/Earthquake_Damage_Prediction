# 🎯 **Project Objective**
This project predicts the **damage grade of buildings** affected by the  
**2015 Gorkha Earthquake (Nepal)** using machine learning.

The target variable:

| Damage Grade | Meaning |
|--------------|----------|
| **1** | Low damage |
| **2** | Medium damage |
| **3** | Heavy/Complete destruction |

# 📊 **1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**

## **Dataset Insights**
- 260,601 buildings  
- 39 features + 1 target  
- Structural + material + geographic information  

## **Key EDA Findings**
- **Material types heavily influence damage**
  - Mud, Adobe, Stone → high damage  
  - Reinforced Concrete (Engineered) → low damage  
- **Old and tall buildings show severe destruction**
- **Damage patterns differ by geographic cluster**
- **Secondary-use buildings (schools, rentals, industry) require priority reinforcement**
